                My name is <strong>Harold Talavera</strong>. I come from the Philippines, a country
                rich in culture and warmth. I worked for 12 years as a C# ASP.Net Developer in a
                media company.
              </p>
              <p>
                I love to travel, which is why it's the theme of my website. I have already visited
                South Korea, Tokyo Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, and, especially, the beautiful
                beaches in my home country, the Philippines.
              </p>
              <p>
                These travels have been more than just sightseeing. They've been a journey of
                self-discovery, allowing me to immerse myself in diverse cultures and breathtaking
                landscapes. Each experience has not only broadened my perspectives but has also
                provided me with valuable insights.
